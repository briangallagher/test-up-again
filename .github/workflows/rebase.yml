name: Rebase Downstream on Upstream with PR
# This workflow keeps a downstream branch up to date by rebasing it onto an
# upstream branch and opening/updating a PR with the rebased result.
#
# Why rebase?
# - Keeps a linear history on the downstream branch, making it easier to read.
# - Ensures downstream changes are replayed on top of upstream, reducing merge
#   noise.
#
# How it works at a glance:
# 1) Checkout downstream branch with full history (fetch-depth: 0)
# 2) Add and fetch the upstream remote
# 3) Detect if upstream is already contained in downstream; if yes, exit early
# 4) Rebase downstream onto upstream
# 5) Push rebased history to a temporary branch (force-with-lease)
# 6) Create or update a PR from the temporary branch into downstream using GH CLI
